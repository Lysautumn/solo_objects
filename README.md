- To practice working with objects, for Prime homework.
- I chose the Minnesota Twins because they are my favorite sports team.

## Output
- Here is an example of the output: "The Minnesota Twins are my favorite baseball team. I have been a fan since I was a kid, when I cheered for Kirby Puckett and got to see the 1991 World Series Parade. Their mascot is TC Bear and he is awesome. Their newish stadium is Target Field, an outdoor stadium, which is a little weird for Minnesota. The best thing about going to Target Field for a Twins game is the food."
